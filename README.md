#### Summary
<p>
This project was challenging for me, especially when it came to making the clock tick. It took me a few days but with a lot of trial and errors, watching videos and google, I was able to make the clock tick. That was the highlight of the project and I was very proud of myself for figuring it out. I'm ejoying doing Javascript as its challenging but it gets me excited when using it to manipulate the DOM.
